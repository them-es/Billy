## Billy

**Billy by them.es** is a business-oriented billing suiteâ€”tailored for freelancers and small agencies that integrates seamlessly into an existing WordPress environment.

The **FREE version** is available on the WordPress Plugins Directory under [https://wordpress.org/plugins/billy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/billy)
For more information and a showcase and for purchasing the **PRO Add-on** check out [https://them.es/plugins/billy](https://them.es/plugins/billy)

## What's included?

-   Custom Post types with Blocks and Block templates.
-   Privacy by design: All information published will be made private by default and stays confidential as no data is being shared with third-parties.

## Compatible themes

The Plugin should work with any modern WordPress theme that supports the Block editor. Minor style modifications may be required.
**Heads up:** Please note that the main content area of the **Single/Custom Post Template** needs to be "fullwidth". Having a sidebar may narrow the (invoice) table layout too much.
