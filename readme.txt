Create invoices, quotes and keep track of your earnings and expenses with this billing suiteâ€”tailored for freelancers and small agencies.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you speed-up your billing process, from creating invoices or quotes, minimizing any potential errors to getting paid faster.
Create an electronic invoice, a quote or accounting records in just a matter of minutes with the block-based WordPress editor. Invoice numbers are generated automatically in unique and sequential order. For convenience reasons the totals of the table rows are calculated in _What You See Is What You Get_ real-time.
Global settings like your name, your address, the invoice number format, tax rates and the currency can be defined in the Customizer. The post header can be branded with your logo. Any frontend styles will be inherited from the theme, so please make sure the theme installed on your site fully supports the Block editor.

= Target group? =

* Freelancers and small agencies that need a billing suite which integrates seamlessly into their existing WordPress environment.

= Compatible themes? =

The plugin should work with any modern WordPress theme that supports the Block editor. Minor style modifications in the theme may be required.
__Heads up:__ Please note that the main content area of the __Single/Custom Post Template__ of your theme needs to be setup in "fullwidth" format. Having a sidebar may narrow the (invoice) table layout too much.

The following WordPress themes have been tested:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the developer documentation? =
* __Demos and docs can be found here:__
  * [https://them.es/plugins/billy](https://them.es/plugins/billy "them.es")

= Are there any recommended third-party plugins? =
* Since you're using a self hosted version for your billing data, installing a [WordPress Backup Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/backup "WordPress Backup Plugin") should be mandatory.
* Furthermore [Exporting your Customizer options](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/customizer+export "WordPress Customizer Export Plugin") is highly recommended since Customizer values may get lost when switching your theme.

= Where can I get help? =
* You can ask questions or post feature requests in the Support forums
  * [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/billy](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/billy "WordPress Support")
  * [https://them.es/support](https://them.es/support "them.es Support")

= The billing templates don't look good in my theme =
* Please note that we can't support you in getting individual themes customized. But if your theme supports the Block editor everything should work out of the box. Minor CSS changes may be required.
* The plugin has been tested with the latest default WordPress themes and with some other major themes.

= How can I style the billing templates? =
* This plugin uses core Gutenberg block styles - so your theme needs to support Gutenberg blocks.
* All Billy templates are inheriting the styles of your theme. If required you can edit the __style.css__ file of your theme or add __custom CSS__ in the [Customizer](https://www.google.com/search?q=wordpress+customizer+add+custom+css "Customizer").

= How do I create a PDF version of my invoices/quotes? =
* A PDF-Exporter is included.
* If you need an exact copy of the screen version you can try the [Print to PDF feature](https://www.google.com/search?q=print+to+pdf "Print to PDF") built into your operating system.

= How do I create an UBL e-invoice? =
* This is only possible in the [PRO add-on](https://them.es/plugins/billy "them.es Billy") and considered "beta" support.
* You can generate a XML that can be sent to third-parties for further processing.

= Why do I see a 404 error page when trying to open an invoice/quote? =
* __Billing information is sensitive data!__ Due to privacy reasons these posts cannot be made public which means that only authorized users have access. You need to be logged in to see private posts.
* If you would like to share a post with others you need to use the __Share Link option__ in the [PRO add-on](https://them.es/plugins/billy "them.es Billy").

= I need more features! =
* Please check out the __PRO add-on__ which is available for purchase here: [https://them.es/plugins/billy](https://them.es/plugins/billy "them.es Billy")
* WordPress developers are welcome to help improve the plugin via [GitHub](https://github.com/them-es "GitHub")
